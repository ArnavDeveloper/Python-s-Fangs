# 🐍 Python’s Fangs  
> “Learning Python, one bite at a time.”  

Welcome to my learning journey in Python!  
This repository holds my early Python projects as I explore new concepts, improve structure, and gradually move toward building my very own home made AI.

## ⚙️ Projects  

### 🧮 Basic Calculator  
A simple calculator prototype :my first Python project!  
-> Built using **if-else logic** and **basic arithmetic operators**.  
-> I plan to improve it with **functions** and maybe **voice input** later as I gradually step up.  
> _“Numbers are the first steps towards new discoveries.”_ 😄

#### 🧮 Updated Basic Calculator V2
Next version of my very basic calculator prototype: A **continuous calculator**! 
->Built using help of **loops** and **conditionals** and **basic arithmetic operators**. 
->I plan to improve upon this even more in the future. 
-> Includes input validation to prevent invalid choices and division by zero.  
-> Prints the current result after each operation for better usability.
>*I have loved the journey so far*😁

### 🏪 Simple Store Program  
A beginner friendly store simulator built using **lists** and **loops**.  
-> Lets you select items, enter quantities, and view the total bill.  
-> Next step: I’ll add **GST**, **discount logic**, and a **receipt printout** feature.

### 🎲🎮 OddEve_Dice_Cricket Game Program
Odd-Eve is a cult classic among school students. Its a game based on luck and bit of intuition. I decided to convert this hand game to a program using:
->random package
->Highly nested if-else loop
->Extremely basic logic based decision making
What I wish to improve:
->Using function to make it less cluttered and modular. 
->Making it risk free of error. 

#### 🎮 How To Play
Step 1: Choose **Odd** or **Eve**. 
Step 2: Choose from any number between 1 to 6 as your move. Your goal is to make a move such that the sum of your no. Is odd or even depending on your choice. 
Step 3: If you win you choose batting or balling otherwise the computer chooses. 

🥎 **Game Rules**
**In Batting :** Choose a number between 1 and 6. The number you pick will be added to your score.
Your goal is to score as many runs as possible.
You will be out if your number matches the opponent’s bowling number.
**In Bowling :** Try to guess the number your opponent will choose.
If your guess matches their number, they’re out — and you stop them from scoring.

🧩 **Creator Note :**
This is my first attempt at turning a traditional hand game into a Python program.
I plan to evolve it with better logic and structure as I keep learning.
I hope you have fun and please gives critics.

## 🚀 What’s Next  
I’m currently learning:
-> Data structures (lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues)
-> File handling in Python
-> Object-oriented programming  
-> And I’ll soon connect my Python logic with **AI concepts** I’m learning side by side.
