# 🐍 Python’s Fangs  
> “Learning Python, one bite at a time.”  

Welcome to my learning journey in Python!  
This repository holds my early Python projects as I explore new concepts, improve structure, and gradually move toward building my very own home made AI.

## ⚙️ Projects  

### 🧮 Basic Calculator  
A simple calculator prototype :my first Python project!  
-> Built using **if-else logic** and **basic arithmetic operators**.  
-> I plan to improve it with **functions** and maybe **voice input** later as I gradually step up.  
> _“Numbers are the first steps towards new discoveries.”_ 😄

#### 🧮 Updated Basic Calculator V2
Next version of my very basic calculator prototype: A **continuous calculator**! 
->Built using help of **loops** and **conditionals** and **basic arithmetic operators**. 
->I plan to improve upon this even more in the future. 
-> Includes input validation to prevent invalid choices and division by zero.  
-> Prints the current result after each operation for better usability.
>*I have loved the journey so far*😁

### 🏪 Simple Store Program  
A beginner friendly store simulator built using **lists** and **loops**.  
-> Lets you select items, enter quantities, and view the total bill.  
-> Next step: I’ll add **GST**, **discount logic**, and a **receipt printout** feature.

## 🚀 What’s Next  
I’m currently learning:
-> Data structures (lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues)
-> File handling in Python
-> Object-oriented programming  
-> And I’ll soon connect my Python logic with **AI concepts** I’m learning side by side.
